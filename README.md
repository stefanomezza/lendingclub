# lendingclub
Python regressor for the LendingClub data. This project contains three files:
* LendingClub.py - LendingClub class implementing the classifier
* run.py - an example of how to use the various methods of the class
* LendingClub.csv - the CSV data
The run.py scripts can be launched with the command


> python run.py <csv_file> 


The whole code is written using Python 2.7 and uses the matplotlib and sklearn libraries.


The current configuration of the run.py file trains, tests and evaluates a regressor based on GradientBoosting. 
You will find the command to train regressors based on SVR and Logistic Regression commented in the file.
